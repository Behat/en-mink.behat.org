Contributing
============

Reporting issues
----------------

If your issue affects only a single driver, it should be reported to the
driver itself.
Any other issues in the Mink abstraction layer and feature requests should
be reported to the `main Mink repository`_.

Contributing features
---------------------

Contributions should be sent using GitHub pull requests.

Any contribution should be covered by tests to be accepted. Changes impacting
drivers should include tests in the common driver testsuite to ensure consistency
between implementations.

New features should always be contributed to the `main Mink repository`_
first. Features submitted only to a single driver without being part of the
Mink abstraction won't be accepted.
